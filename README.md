# Heterogeneous Topic Interdependencies
 
This repository contains code used to run simulations for the project "Heterogeneous Topic Interdependencies in Friedkin-Johnsen Models of Opinion Dynamics" (Andy Liu, Prof. Heather Zinn Brooks). The specific commands used are in ```Main.jl```.

Note that the code does not yet support custom network setups, instead using a hardcoded Laplacian matrix for 3 topics and 8 agents.
